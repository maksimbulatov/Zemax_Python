Python scripts to run Zemax simulations

Here i would like to share my scripts for Zemax simulations, written in Python. 

I hope someone would find it usefull.

It is strictly for educational purposes, but one can use it for projects and work. 

1) christmas_tree_NSC_Zemax.py - create a christmas tree based on triangles in Zemax NSC mode. Basic code for communication with Zemax and adding objects and changing the object position.
